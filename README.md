## My process

### 🛠️Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology
- Accessible markup (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### ✨Features

- Responsive card layout

- Keyboard-accessible navigation
- High color contrast and readable typography
- Clean and scalable CSS architecture

### 📚What I learned

During this project I reinforced:

- How to apply **BEM naming conventions** correctly
- The importance of using **real interactive elements** instead of only visual cues
- How to improve **accessibility** with `aria-labelledby` and `:focus-visible`
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable CSS using variables

### ♿Accessibility

This project follows basic **WCAG 2.1 AA** guidelines:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard-accessible links
- Visible focus states
- Descriptive alternative text for images.

### 🚀Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve animation and micro-interactions
- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Continue refining accessibility best practices
